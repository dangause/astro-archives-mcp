"""Shared dataclass → JSON-friendly dict helper.

Used by tools whose envelope is built from a frozen dataclass: turns
tuples (any nesting depth, including 2-tuples-in-a-tuple) into lists,
MappingProxyType into plain dict, and date into ISO 8601 string.
Everything else passes through unchanged.

`dataclasses.asdict` is unusable here because its internal `deepcopy`
call fails on `MappingProxyType` (the proxy isn't picklable). Walking
`fields()` ourselves avoids the deepcopy and keeps the conversion
explicit. The recursive `_jsonable` also preserves tuple-as-list and
date-as-ISO-string semantics, both of which `asdict` gets wrong for
our MCP envelope edge.
