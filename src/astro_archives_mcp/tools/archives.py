"""Tool for surfacing the curated KNOWN_ARCHIVES registry to the LLM.

`vo_archive_list` is the agent-facing entry point into the project's
knowledge base of well-known IVOA archives. Each returned entry carries
the canonical endpoint URLs, capabilities, notable tables, and — most
importantly — `usage_notes` that capture archive-specific gotchas
(non-standard table locations, sync-vs-async routing, target-name
conventions, etc.).

This is the early scaffolding for what will become a richer knowledge
layer. Today it surfaces `known_archives.KNOWN_ARCHIVES` directly;
later it will be backed by something pluggable (RAG, structured KB,
etc.) but the tool contract stays the same.

    """List the IVOA archives this server has first-class knowledge of.

    Each entry includes the archive's endpoint URLs (TAP / SIA / SCS),
    waveband, description, notable tables, and **usage_notes** — short
    agent-facing strings capturing archive-specific gotchas like
    non-standard table locations, sync-vs-async routing recommendations,
    target-name conventions, and ADQL quirks.

    Call this FIRST when planning a query against an archive whose
    behavior you don't already know — it'll save you the trial-and-error
    of discovering quirks through failed queries. The notes are curated
    based on real friction encountered while building the server.

    Pass `short_name` and/or `waveband` to narrow the result. With no
    arguments it returns every known archive (the usage_notes are verbose,
    so prefer `short_name` once you know which archive you need).

    Archives not listed here still work via `vo_registry_search` followed
    by `vo_registry_describe` / `vo_tap_query` — this tool only covers the
    well-known set.
