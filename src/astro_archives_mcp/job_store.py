"""In-memory keyed JobStore for async TAP job handles.

Sibling of result_store.py. Stores enough state to re-hydrate an UWS
job (job_url, plus debug-friendly metadata) and serve /health stats.
Process lifetime; lost on restart. Single-instance (no cross-worker
sharing — fine for Slice 5's single-process deployment).

Eviction is check-on-read: when `get` finds an expired entry, it deletes
it before returning None. No background sweeper.

The JobStore is a directory, not a cache: it does NOT hold the result
bytes or the live phase. The bytes (after fetch) live in result_store;
the phase is always live-fetched from the upstream UWS.
