"""Archive-label lookup — fast, deterministic, no network.

Two-step resolution:
  1. Static substring map derived from `known_archives.KNOWN_ARCHIVES`
     (the curated short_names; no I/O, fast path)
  2. Hostname-derived label for everything else (e.g. 'archive.eso.org'
     -> 'eso'), memoized in a process-lifetime cache

The label is a cosmetic field on response envelopes (`archive`). It does
NOT hit the IVOA registry: an earlier version fell back to a RegTAP scan
of every registered TAP service just to read one `short_name`, which
added multi-second latency to the first query against any unregistered
endpoint. A hostname-derived label is good enough for a display string
and costs nothing.

Cache is keyed by the full endpoint URL (not just hostname) so distinct
services on the same host get distinct labels. Restart wipes it; the
derivation is deterministic, so a stale entry is never wrong.

To add an archive to the static map, add it to `KNOWN_ARCHIVES` in
`known_archives.py`. Both `archive_label` and `is_known_archive_url`
pick it up automatically.
