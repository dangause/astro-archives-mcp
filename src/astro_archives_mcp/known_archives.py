"""Canonical registry of IVOA archives the server has first-class knowledge of.

This is the single source of truth for:

- Endpoint URLs surfaced in tool schemas (`Field(examples=...)`)
- Host substrings used by `_archive_label._STATIC_MAP` (archive labels +
  SSRF allow-list for `vo_sia_fetch`)
- Test fixtures (instead of duplicating URL strings)

Archives not listed here still work zero-touch via `vo_registry_search` —
this module is just for the well-known ones we want the LLM to see in
the tool schemas and operators to see labeled in responses.

To add a new archive: add one `Archive(...)` entry to `KNOWN_ARCHIVES`.
No other file needs to be touched. Derived structures (the substring
map, schema examples, allow-list) update automatically.
