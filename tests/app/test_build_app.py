"""Integration tests for ``build_app()``.

These exercise the Starlette wiring via ``httpx.ASGITransport`` so the
FastMCP lifespan, the request-id middleware, and the ``/mcp`` mount path are
all hit. The in-memory MCP client used by ``tests/tools/`` bypasses Starlette
entirely, which is why the lifespan bug originally slipped through review.

NOTE: ``httpx.ASGITransport`` does NOT run ASGI lifespan events on its own.
We drive ``app.router.lifespan_context(app)`` manually so FastMCP's
StreamableHTTPSessionManager task group is initialized before any request.
Without this, hitting ``/mcp`` raises
``RuntimeError(StreamableHTTPSessionManager task group was not initialized)``
— which is exactly the regression we are guarding against.
